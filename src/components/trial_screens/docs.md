Trial screens display stimuli and record responses during a variety of tasks.

As such they usually inherit from [`<LifecycleScreen>`](./#lifecyclescreen), including its 4 life cycle phases:

* Pause
* Fixation
* Stimulus presentation
* Response

This means, for all trial screens you can adjust pause, fixation point and stimulus duration and can
replace fixation and stimulus contents via component slots as seen over at [`<LifecycleScreen>`](./#lifecyclescreen).
