## Documentation
The API reference for the latest version is available at [magpie-reference.netlify.app](https://magpie-reference.netlify.app).

A guided introduction to building experiments with magpie v3 is available at [magpie-manual.netlify.app](https://magpie-manual.netlify.app).


## Core Development

### Development principles
 * Components should not expose CSS classes for manipulation but instead offer customization either via unstyled slots or via props.
 * Pre-packaged screens are more of a convenience should be rather easy to replicate with normal userland code

### Linting
Before committing changes it is recommended to run the linter to make sure the changes adhere to the general coding style.

Run the js/vue linter using

```
npm run lint:fix
```

and the css linter using

```
npm run stylelint:fix
```

### Tests
Ideally every feature should be covered by at least one unit test. Unit tests are run on every commit and pull requests,
so we can quickly detect whenever a change breaks something.

Run the unit tests using

```
npm run test:unit
```

For implementing tests we're using [the jest framework](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) in combination
with [vue test utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/).

### Docs
In order to spin up a local web server with the docs run `npm run docs`.

In order to build the docs run `npm run docs:build`.

The contents and organization of the docs are declared in `styleguide.config.js`. Each source folder should have a `docs.md` file with a general introduction to the feature in said folder.

The online docs are automatically built from the latest commit of the master branch.

### Vue components
All Vue components must be exported in `src/components/index.js` in order to be available in downstream projects without importing them.
